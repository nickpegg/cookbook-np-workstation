# np-workstation
Sets up a personal workstation the way I like it

## Personal Cookbook Notice
This is a personal cookbook and I haven't really taken the care to generalize
it. It's public in hopes that maybe it's of use to someone, either directly
with its content or seeing how I do things with Chef.

## Testing
It's assumed that you have chefdk installed.

```bash
chef exec rake
chef exec kitchen test
```
